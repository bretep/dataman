- interact with "metadata"
    -- limit access to databases we are configured for
    -- do schema enforcement/validation/etc.
    -- user access control
    -- configure/use indexes as defined
- determine the primary key of items based on schema (instead of hard-coded id?) (or require id always?)
- admin API (for internal use)
    -- add/remove databases
- reserved namespace (don't touch dbs starting with "_" -- they are internal only)
- separate deserialization as its own pluggable thing in the http API (probably in some shared lib-- since we'll use it in both the router and storage nodes)
