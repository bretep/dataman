Determine how we want to map dataman schemas to sql schema

Option 1:
    shove everything into "value" and use additional columns only for indexes

    Pros:
        - Easy to implement
        - Consistent base schema across tables
    Cons:
        - change to a single attribute requires reading, unmarshaling, editing, marshaling, and writing the data

Option 2:
    Create a column per top-level property in the schema

    Pros:
        - more "SQL"-esque
        - makes additions of indexes easy (assuming the index is on a top-level property)

    Cons:
        - more complex schema, that will differ a lot (and indexes on sub-items will require more compex exclusions)

# Doing this for now
Option 3:
    Shove everything into "value" as a json field (with index-- since postgres will do that)

    Pros:
        - simplest implementation
        - dynamic indexes

    Cons:
        - least space efficient
        - requires indexing the entire json entry, even though we might not ever use it
